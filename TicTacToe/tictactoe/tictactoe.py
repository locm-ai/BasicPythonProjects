"""
Our game is almost ready! Now let's combine what weâ€™ve learned in the previous
stages to make a game of tic-tac-toe that two players can play from the
beginning (with an empty grid) through to the end (until there is a draw, or
one of the players wins).
The first player has to play as X and their opponent plays as O.


In this stage, we will write a program that:
    Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.
    Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell
coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a grid with the
changes if everything is okay.
    Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.
    You need to output the final result at the end of the game.
