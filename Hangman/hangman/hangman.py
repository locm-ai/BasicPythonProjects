Take on the popular game Hangman
Eventually will include the following aspects
    In the main menu, a player can choose to either play or exit the game.
    If the user chooses to play, the computer picks a word from a list: this will be the answer to the puzzle.
    The computer asks the player to enter a letter that they think is in the word.
    If that letter does not appear in the word and this letter hasn't already been guessed, the computer counts it as a miss. A player can only afford 8 misses before the game is over.
    If the letter does occur in the word, the computer notifies the player. If there are letters left to guess, the computer invites the player to go on.
    When the entire word is uncovered, it's a victory! The game calculates the final score and returns to the main menu.

Adding the following functionality
    A player has exactly 8 tries and enters letters. Nothing changes if a player has more tries left but they have already guessed the word.
    If the letter doesn't appear in the word, the computer takes one try away â€“ even if the user has already guessed this letter.
    If the player doesn't have any more attempts, the game should end and the program should show a losing message. Otherwise, the player can continue to input letters.
    Also, the word should be selected from our list: 'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript', so that your program can be tested more reliably.
