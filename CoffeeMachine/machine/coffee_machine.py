"""
Starting with a program that makes you a coffee â€“ virtual coffee, of course.
In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee
machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can
offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the
prepared drink.

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It should print to
the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.
