    Just one action is not so interesting, is it? Let's improve the program so it
can do multiple actions, one after another. It should repeatedly ask a user
what they want to do. If the user types "buy", "fill" or "take", then the
program should do exactly the same thing it did in the previous step. However,
if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, they should type "exit".
The program should terminate on this command. Also, when the user types
"remaining", the program should output all the resources that the coffee
machine has.

    The program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested
persons until the shutdown signal is given. Introduce two new options:
"remaining" and "exit".
    There is a chance that you can be out of resources for making coffee. If
the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program
should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.
    And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if the user types
"buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, they should be able to
type "back" to return into the main cycle.
